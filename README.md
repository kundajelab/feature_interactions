Notebooks were run in this order (later notebooks download files pre-generated from previous notebooks, so as a user you do not have to run each one notebook sequentially to replicate the results; later notebooks will download the data they need):
- Generate_Data.ipynb
- TrainModels.ipynb
- ComputeModelPerfs.ipynb
- ComputeModelPredsForEvaluation.ipynb
- EvaluateModelsGivenPredictionData.ipynb
